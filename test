1. Undirected Graph:
- edges have no orientation
2. Directed Graph/ Digraph:
3. Weighted Graphs: (u,v,w)
4. Special graphs:
	- Trees
	- Rooted Tree -> Tree with a designated root node where every
	edge either points away from or towards the root node.
				  -> When edges point away from the root the graph is called
	an arborescence (out-tree) and anti - arborescence (in-tree)
5. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with no cycles.
-> structure with dependencies
-> All out-tree are DAG but not all DAGs are out-tree
6. Bipartite Graph:
7. Complete Graph:


Representing Graphs:
1. Adjacency Matrix:
